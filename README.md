# Introduction

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This is my first attempt at making a mock enterprise grade website for allowing employees to have first class tools at their disposal for everyday work related tasks. This is a toy project that I am building in regards to what I wish I had at my disposal at my workplace.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
